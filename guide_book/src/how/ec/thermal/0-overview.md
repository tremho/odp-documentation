 # Thermal management

 This exercise demonstrates the implementation of a Thermal component service as part of the Embedded Controller (EC) power management system.


 This example will be similar to the battery and charger exercises, but with some differences.

 First, though, we are going to look at an alternate implementation example that focuses on the Microsoft Power Thermal Framework specification. We will revisit these topics again when we walk through our normal implementation exercise, but it is worth reading through this "side tour" to get a foundation for some of the concepts first.

## A Side Tour:
### Exploring the Microsoft Power Thermal Framework specification
Before we begin our example exercise, let's take a look at another example and demo that focuses on the specific characteristics of the Microsoft Power Thermal Framework specification.
