# Setup and Tap
Before we can construct our `ControllerCore` structure, we need to have the allocations of the components ready.
We choose not to pass these around beyond constructing them into a single location, since we may run into borrow violations if we hand the references out too liberally, like we have seen in our previous integration attempts.

This becomes even more complicated by the fact that when we commit our Battery Controller object to the battery service, we pass ownership to it -- and therefore lose access to our own construction.   The solution here is to not give the battery service control of our Battery directly, but to give it a `BatteryAdapter` that looks like a battery, but instead simply forwards all of its actions to our `ControllerCore`.  We call this "tapping" the service. In the `ControllerCore` we have access to not only our own battery, but also our charger and thermal components, so we can conduct our integration in a unified way.  That said, we will still avoid tightly-coupled access between components as much as possible in favor of using messaging, because this pattern fosters better modularity.

```
This starts out by allocating and creating the components that we will need, starting with the aforementioned `BatteryAdapter`, which we will implement in a moment, and creating the `BatteryWrapper` with this in mind.

It then creates the battery, charger, sensor, and fan components.  You may notice that in doing so for the battery and charger, we create both a DEVICE and a POLICY_DEVICE for each.  Both of these Device type wrappers are identical per component.  One is used to create the controller, and one is used to register the device with the service. Since these are tied by Id designation, they are equivalent, and since we can't pass a single instance twice without incurring a borrow violation, we use this technique.

For the sensor and fan, we wrap our controllers in the TS_SENSOR and TS_FAN allocated statics.  These wrappers contain the controllers and device ids, and the profile configurations needed to enact the ODP prescribed thermal-service handling. We then init the thermal service and use these wrappers to register these thermal components into it.

Note the additional items at module-scope to support this.  We call upon the `ts::impl_sensor_task!` and `ts::impl_fan_task!` macros that will generate a task function we can spawn to to support these services.  We also have defined helper functions that allow us to map our policy configuration values to the ODP policy structures for these services.

This brings us to the construction of the `ControllerCore`.  Here, we give it all of the components, plus the comm channels that were shared from our earlier allocations in `entry.rs`.  We also see here we are passing references to a new channel `interaction_channel`, and the `SystemObserver`, neither of which we have created yet.

Once we get our `ControllerCore` instance created, we wrap it into a mutex that we stash into a `StaticCell` so that we have portable access to this structure.

The remainder of the `setup_and_tap_task` proceeds with registration and then spawning the execution tasks.
