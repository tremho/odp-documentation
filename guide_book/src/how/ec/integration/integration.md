# Integration

Before we turn our attention to making an embedded build to a hardware target, we want to make sure that we have a working integration of the 
components in a virtual environment. This will allow us to test the interactions between the components and ensure that they work together as expected before we move on to the embedded build.

In this section, we will cover the integration of all of our example components working together. 
This integration will be similar to the previous examples, but with some additional complexity due to the interaction between the components. We will also explore how to test the integration of these components and ensure that they work together as expected.
